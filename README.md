# DeepPetClassifier
## DeepPetClassifier is a deep learning project that utilizes neural networks to classify images of cats and dogs.
**Target:** To build a model that can recognize cats using Artificial Neural Networks.

**About the model:** We use a model here known as `resnet34`, trained using about `1.3` million images.

**Dataset:** Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (dataset consisting of `7349` pictures of cats and dogs)

## Conclusion

the `"DeepPetClassifier"` project is dedicated to the development of an **Artificial Neural Network model**, specifically utilizing the robust `"resnet34"` architecture. The project's primary objective is the accurate **recognition of cats** within a dataset sourced from the `Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset`, encompassing a substantial collection of `7349` images of both cats and dogs.

Through the application of deep learning techniques, this project seeks to achieve precise and reliable cat recognition, demonstrating the potential of neural networks in solving real-world image classification challenges.
